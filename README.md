# Eridonna
A webshop for slovak jewellery store built on Shopify. In this project I developed a custom theme on Shopify. User can browse through different collections and save products for later by using wishlist. User can buy products as a guest or by loggin in/creating a new account.
Ordering process is more dynamic by working with Shopify REST API endpoints.
